\section{Finite Difference Methods}
A great resource for finite difference methods is the book by \citet{smith1985numerical}. Almost all of the information and methods can be traced back to that book.

\subsection{Wave Equation}
Hyperbolic equations are generally the description of vibrational problems. The (scalar) wave equation is the model hyperbolic equation,
\begin{equation}
  \pdv[2]{u}{t}-c^2\Delta u=f,
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed determined by the medium and $f$ is a source. Considering the homogeneous version of the previous equation. It will be useful to write it in operator form,
\begin{equation}
  D^2_t u - c^2\qty(D^2_x + D^2_y + D^2_z )u=0.
\end{equation}
We proceed as usual in discretizing the derivatives with a \emph{centered differences scheme} that has an error $\order{(h^2)^n}$. Our description of said equation will be at gridpoints $(p\,h,q_i\,k)$, with $h$ being the time step and $k$ the spatial step size\footnote{It need not be the same, but the discretization takes a more complicated form (non uniform grids)}. It will be useful to realize that a (cartesian) centered difference scheme has a general form of a sum of the value of the field at a set of gridpoints $\{x_i\}$ times a set of weights $\{w_i\}$,
\begin{equation}
  D_x u\Rightarrow \frac{1}{k_x}\qty(\dots +w_{i-1} u_{i-1}+ w_{i} u_{i} + w_{i+1} u_{i+1}+\dots),
\end{equation}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_coefficient}{Wikipedia} one gets the required weights for a second order derivative (see \autoref{tab:weights}).

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Weights for discretized $\pdv*[2]{x}$, with error $O(h^n)$ at grid index.}\label{tab:weights}

4 &         & $-1/12$   & $16/12$   & $-30/12$   & $16/12$   & $-1/12$   &         \\\hline
6 & $2/180$ & $-27/180$ & $270/180$ & $-490/180$ & $270/180$ & $-27/180$ & $2/180$ \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{2D operator}
Discretizing a cartesian operator in a cartesian grid translates into summing the respective weights in distinct axes, since $\Delta=\sum_j\pdv*[2]{x_j}$. For example, for our two dimensional $D^2_x+D^2_y$, an approximation of $\order{h^2}$\footnote{Also known as a 5-point lattice} requires the sum of $[1,-2,1]$ and $[1,2,1]^T$. One finds the 2D version of the discretized wave equation to be,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{h^2}\qty(u_{i,j}^{t-1}-2u_{i,j}^{t}+u_{i,j}^{t+1})-\frac{c^2}{h^2}\qty(\underbrace{\mqty[0& 1 & 0\\1&-4&1\\0&1&0]}_{\vb{D}^2}\vdot\mqty[ & u^t_{i,j+1} & \\ u^t_{i-1,j} & u^t_{i,j} & u^t_{i+1,j}\\& u^t_{i,j-1} &] )=0,
\end{equation}
where $\vdot$ implies the dot product. Alternatively, one calls the spatial discretization operator $\vb{D}^2$ and thus writes its product as $\vb{D}^2\vdot\vb{u}$. This expression already hints at the fact that one effectively \emph{convolves} the operator $\vb{D}^2$ with the lattice points, $\vb{D}^2\ast [u]^t$. This is what's done usually in image filters and graphics processing, and what is described in \autoref{alg:wave}.

Solving for $u^{t+1}$, one finds
\begin{equation}
  u_{i,j}^{t+1}=\alpha^2\qty(\vb{D}^2\vdot \vb{u})+2u_{i,j}^t - u_{i,j}^{t-1},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha\equiv ch/k$. One has the freedom of choosing each approximation's error, whether to use more coefficients for $D_t^2$ or for $\vb{D}^2$, or even take it to an $N-$dimensional routine by using a general tensor form of $\vb{D}^2$. One also notices that exchanging $u_{i,j}^{t+1}\leftrightarrow u_{i,j}^{t-1}$ has no effect whatsoever in the final expression.

As with all centered differences, one can kick-start the time-stepping through an explicit Euler scheme,
\[u_{i,j}^{t+1}=u_{i,j}^t+h(c^2\vb{D}^2\vdot \vb{u}),\]
which just implies having to state the initial conditions for $u_{i,j}^{(0)}$ and $u_{i,j}^{(-1)}$ (should one start at $t=0$).
 
Adding a source $f$ requires no further changes other than adding its value $f_{i,j,k}$ at time $t$. The algorithm for the time evolution of the wave equation in a domain $\Omega$, assuming a Dirichlet boundary conditions, and $V$ to be the initial perturbation, can be seen in \autoref{alg:wave}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{FDTD for wave equation}\label{alg:wave}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \State $u^{t-1}\gets 0$
    \State $u^{t}\gets V$
    \State $u^{t+1}\gets 0$
    \While{$N<N_{\rm max}$}
    \State $u^{t+1}=\alpha^2(\vb{D}^2\ast u^t)+2u^t-u^{t-1}$
    \State ${u}^{t+1}(\vb{r}\in\partial \Omega) = 0$\Comment{Enforce Dirichlet B.C.}
    \State $u^{t-1}\gets u^t$
    \State $u^{t}\gets u^{t+1}$ \Comment{Update fields}
    \EndWhile
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsubsection{Image filters}
% Image filters have a long history of development, 
Using an image filtering library has the advantage of an easy implementation of periodic boundary conditions. In Julia, such function is given by \texttt{imfilter(im,ker,"circular")}. Furthermore, it allows generalization to $N$ dimensions, which makes it easy to read and work with. However, such operations can get expensive memory-wise, which is why it might also be recommended to use \texttt{for} loops. For Julia, this is no issue, since \texttt{for} loops should be as fast as Fortran code.

\subsection{Ginzburg-Landau equation}
Ignoring some stability issues with the centered difference method outlined before, once we discretize the $\Delta$ operator, we can apply it to any other equation. Consider the equation
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{\phi}{t}=\phi-\abs{\phi}^2\phi+\Delta\phi,
\end{equation}
where we define $f(\phi)\equiv\phi-|\phi|^2\phi$ for convenience. Using a simple Euler approximation
\[\frac{1}{h}\qty(\phi_{i,j}^{t-1}-2\phi_{i,j}^t+\phi_{i,j}^{t+1})=f_{i,j}^t+\frac{1}{k^2}(\vb{D}^2\ast \phi)_{i,j}^t\]
